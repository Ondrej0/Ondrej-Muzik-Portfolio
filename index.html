        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am currently a second-year student at the University of the West of England (UWE), pursuing a BSc in Business Computing. My passion for technology, particularly software development, started as a hobby while learning game development in my spare time, but quickly evolved into a love for creating projects and solving complex problems.<br><br>

            I have a solid understanding of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with proficiency in algorithms and data structures. In addition, I have a strong grasp of UX/UI design principles, and I am skilled in Figma for designing user interfaces.<br><br>
            
            One of my professional highlights includes developing and launching a fully functional WordPress website with a user database for a UWE client using Hostinger. This experience allowed me to apply my knowledge of PHP and relational databases in a real-world setting, complementing the skills I've gained through university projects. </p>

                <p>Me and another student were given full control over designing, developing and launching a website for UWE BREAS.
                    This project was a great opportunity to familiarise my self with WordPress, Hostinger, design and databases. In addition the experience was great for learning how to understand the requirements client has set as well as how to efficiently split work with my colleague.

                <p  class="workTitle">SummaryAI</p>
                <p>I developed an AI-powered article summarization tool in React with Tailwind for the styling designed to streamline content consumption. The tool can quickly extract key insights from lengthy articles, providing concise summaries while retaining essential information. Built with a focus on efficiency and user experience, this project demonstrates my ability to work with AI models, automate tasks, and deploy solutions that enhance productivity.</p>

                <p  class="workTitle">PagePal</p>
                <p>PagePal allows user to make a reading list. This is done by either manually adding each book or adding a Excel spread sheet, which gets converted into JSON file, then uploaded using 
                a external library. The books have a cover picture, this is done using a API which uses the name of the book to fetch cover. Search bar is also included in this as well as the ability to mark books as read and delete them. This project was great for improving my OOP skills in JavaScript.</p>

                <p  class="workTitle">Pixelz</p>
                <p>Pixelz is a web app that allows the user to select size of a grid, pick any colour they want, draw a pixel art image and then export that image as a PNG file.
                    The aim of this project was to practise my DOM manipulation and expand on my JavaScript coding skills. If I were to mak any improvements I would try to code a fill in area function too. </p>

                <p  class="workTitle">VelocityFitness</p>
                <p>Velocity Fitness is a mock website for a gym, I only designed the home page because the main focus was just to practise my ability to make the website look good and be responsive. Some highlights are the header bar which hides on small devices as well as the use of ‚Äúclamp‚Äù and flexbox for responsive design.
                    If i were to do it again I would focus more on design and over all look of the website as it can look a bit crowded right now. </p>

                <p>This app allows the user to search any country or city adn it will provide weather information to the user. This app was my first experience with an API and was very beneficial for my JavaScript skills. If i were to improve anything it would be the over all design and look of the app, as well as adding extra funtionalities. </p>
